    DOCTYPE is important and MUST appear first in your HTML files!

    will be rendering. Without this, browsers run in quirks mode which
    can lead to unexpected behavior.

            The <script> element allows you to load script files from external local files or remote URLs.
            You can also embed script code directly in between the element without the need for an external source.
            Script elements can only be used in the <head> or <body> elements.
                
            You can think of this like an #include directive in C/C++ or an import in Python.

            The type attribute tells the web browser what type of script to try and execute.

            Vertex and fragment shader scripts written in GLSL can be embedded directly into the HTML.
            NOTE: You can load this code from an external file (extension .glsl), but you will need
            to run a local server to load your webpage. This is do to a security feature of most modern
            browsers. If you have Python installed, you can start a webserver using the command
            python -m http.server (on Mac or Linux you might need to use python3 -m http.server)
            in the root of your WebGL project directory.

            The type attribute value "text/javascript" tells the web browser the script will be javascript.
            While this this particular value is an older part of the HTML standard and has been 
            replaced by "application/javascript", the "text/javascript" is understood as equivalent
            by the largest number of browsers and is still recommended by the HTML Living Standards:
            (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#scriptingLanguages)
     
            The defer and async attributes both allow script files to be downloaded asynchronosly
            but the execution of the script happens at different times. With async, the script will
            be executed immediately after download. Defer forces the execution of the script to happpen
            after the HTML document has been parsed. Since our HTML content is so minimal and only impacts the
            canvas element, the attributes are provided here simply for example and will have no noticable
            impact on presentation or page loading times. Older browsers may not support this attribute.
            
            Without these attributes, the browser waits until downloading script is complete, executes the script,
            and then continues parsing the HTML (synchronous). This means that scripts without defer or async are
            downloaded and processed in the order they appear in the HTML document.
